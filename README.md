# college-result-login-app

## Introduction

This college result login application is designed and implemented as an educational exercise to demonstrate our backend skills acquired during multiverse bootcamp backend module training. The aim of this mini-react application is to enable a college to keep students result secure. We want to create an API in which registrar admin or other authorized admin to log in and manage (perform CRUD operation) on students result entries, while keeping them safe from fraud, or from being deleted or updated by an unauthorized body.
